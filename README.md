## **React global state management**, the performant, type safe and easy way

Heavily inspired by [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) and [react-sweet-state](https://github.com/atlassian/react-sweet-state)

### What if we combine [**immer**](https://github.com/immerjs/immer), [**reselect**](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) and even [**React Context API**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to make a performant and expressive React global state manager?
